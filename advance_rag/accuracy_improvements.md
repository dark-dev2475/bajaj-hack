# Accuracy Optimization Changes

## Problem Analysis
The RAG pipeline was optimized for speed but sacrificed accuracy. Key issues identified:

1. **Chunk sizes too small** - [400, 200, 100] didn't capture enough context
2. **No chunk overlap** - Lost continuity between document sections  
3. **Text length too short** - 400 characters insufficient for meaningful content
4. **Limited retrieval** - Only 3 documents retrieved, missing relevant context
5. **Conservative context limit** - 3000 chars limited answer quality
6. **Too deterministic** - Temperature 0.1 produced robotic responses
7. **Short answers** - 500 token limit prevented detailed explanations

## Accuracy Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Document Parsing
```python
# BEFORE (vm_optimized_config.py)
chunk_sizes = [400, 200, 100]
chunk_overlap = 0
max_tokens_per_chunk = 300

# AFTER (accuracy_optimized_config.py)  
chunk_sizes = [800, 400, 200]  # 2x larger for richer context
chunk_overlap = 50             # Added continuity between chunks
max_tokens_per_chunk = 600     # 2x more tokens for complete thoughts
```

### 2. Improved Text Processing
```python
# BEFORE
max_text_length = 400          # Too short for meaningful content
batch_size = 10               # Conservative processing

# AFTER  
max_text_length = 800         # 2x longer for better context
batch_size = 16              # Balanced efficiency and stability
```

### 3. Enhanced Retrieval
```python
# BEFORE
similarity_top_k = 3          # Limited context retrieval

# AFTER
similarity_top_k = 5          # More comprehensive context
```

### 4. Better Answer Generation
```python
# BEFORE
max_context_length = 3000     # Limited context for answers
temperature = 0.1             # Too deterministic
max_output_tokens = 500       # Short answers

# AFTER
max_context_length = 5000     # 67% more context
temperature = 0.3             # More nuanced responses  
max_output_tokens = 800       # 60% longer, detailed answers
```

### 5. Smarter Text Boundaries
```python
# BEFORE
separators = ["\n\n", "\n", " ", ""]

# AFTER  
separators = ["\n\n", "\n", ". ", " ", ""]  # Added sentence boundary
```

## Expected Accuracy Improvements

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Chunk Context | 400 chars | 800 chars | +100% |
| Answer Context | 3000 chars | 5000 chars | +67% |
| Documents Retrieved | 3 | 5 | +67% |
| Answer Length | 500 tokens | 800 tokens | +60% |
| Chunk Continuity | None | 50 overlap | New feature |
| Response Nuance | 0.1 temp | 0.3 temp | More natural |

## Performance Impact

While these changes prioritize accuracy, they maintain reasonable performance:

- **Embedding**: 16 batch size balances speed and memory
- **Timeouts**: Kept at 5 minutes to prevent gateway issues
- **Processing**: Async architecture maintained for efficiency
- **Memory**: CPU optimization still active for cloud deployment

## Validation Recommendations

To verify accuracy improvements:

1. **Test with complex queries** requiring multiple document sources
2. **Compare answer detail** between old and new configurations  
3. **Check context relevance** with longer chunk sizes
4. **Verify sentence continuity** with overlap and boundaries
5. **Assess response naturalness** with higher temperature

## Rollback Plan

If performance becomes an issue, can selectively revert:
- Reduce chunk_sizes to [600, 300, 150] (middle ground)
- Lower max_context_length to 4000 
- Reduce similarity_top_k to 4
- Keep other accuracy improvements

The new configuration strikes a balance between the aggressive speed optimization and maintaining answer quality.
